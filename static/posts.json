After some time, I decided to ask [\"How to use Godot's resources in rust bindings?\"](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues/559) Perhaps [\"Getting Started book\"](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/getting-started.html) will have a chapter on this topic, but for now, the simple example which I have prepared seems to be \"good enough\" solution to show others the basics of this library.\n\nIt was my first ever open source contribution. This is just a small example but first **merge** to open source project feels amazing. I can't wait to contribute to OSS again ðŸ”¥. ",

Tackling unknown domain with newly learned language was quite a challenge. But thanks to [rust lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community, beginner friendly examples provided by [seed-rs](https://seed-rs.org/) and incomparably good explanation of fundamentals from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), it was nothing less than a pleasant challenge.",
