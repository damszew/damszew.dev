On this blog, I'm sharing my thoughts about different practices, patterns or methodologies used in software development.

On daily basis, I'm Rust developer with C++ background. Currently, I'm working on critical path system for energy sector which involves performing real-time operations on high volume, high frequency data streams.

In my free time I like tinkering ðŸ”§, learning new technologies ðŸ’» and gym ðŸ’ª.
