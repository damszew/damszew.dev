Iâ€™m a Rust developer with C++ background.
I've worked on:

- embedded distributed system of base stations that communicate with each other to route calls.
- a critical path system for the energy sector which involves performing real-time operations on high volume, high-frequency data streams.
- backend for mobile app and CMS for online casinos

I'm a technology enthusiast. In my free time, I'm always coding something new. It can be another pet project that serves me as an example to describe concepts that I'm currently hyped about (mainly related to TDD) on my blog or setup of home k8s cluster on RPis, just to over-engineer smart light bulb controls and learn cloud-native solutions in the meantime. I also enjoy jogging tho'.

In this blog, I'm sharing my thoughts about different practices, patterns, or methodologies used in software development.
