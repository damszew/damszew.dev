My very first pet project that I want to show to the world. Being more of a system level dev, I have always wanted to create something more visual. Tackling unknown domain with newly learned language was quite a challenge. But thanks to [rust lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community, beginner friendly examples provided by [seed-rs](https://seed-rs.org/) and incomparably good explanation of fundamentals from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), it was nothing less than a pleasant challenge.
