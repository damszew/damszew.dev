Recently I started messing around with [godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust) and while doing so, I ran into one of these problems that felt like they should be easy to solve, but I couldn't get it to work. After some time, I decided to ask [\"How to use Godot's resources in rust bindings?\"](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues/559) Perhaps [\"Getting Started book\"](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/getting-started.html) will have a chapter on this topic, but for now, the simple example which I have prepared seems to be \"good enough\" solution to show others the basics of this library.\n\nIt was my first ever open source contribution. This is just a small example but first **merge** to open source project feels amazing. I can't wait to contribute to OSS again ðŸ”¥.
