                and while doing so, I ran into one of these problems that felt like they should be easy to solve, but I couldn't get it to work.
                After some time, I decided to ask [\"How to use Godot's resources in rust bindings?\"](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues/559)
                Perhaps [\"Getting Started book\"](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/getting-started.html) will have a chapter on this topic,
                but for now, the simple example which I have prepared seems to be \"good enough\" solution to show others the basics of this library.


    It was my first ever open source contribution. This is just a small example
                but first **merge** to open source project feels amazing.
                I can't wait to contribute to OSS again ðŸ”¥.

                Being more of a system level dev, I have always wanted to create something more visual.
                Tackling unknown domain with newly learned language was quite a challenge.
                But thanks to [rust lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community, beginner friendly examples provided by [seed-rs](https://seed-rs.org/)
                and incomparably good explanation of fundamentals from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), it was nothing less than a pleasant challenge.",
